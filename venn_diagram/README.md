# Venn diagrams

Venn diagrams are generated by an `R` script in `sbom2023_plot` directory.
There are 3 types of Venn diagrams in the repository:

1. [Supervenn](https://github.com/gecko984/supervenn)
2. Triangular Venn diagram that @MartinWitt found.
3. And finally, the diagrams in `venn_diagram/venns` that were actually
    used for the paper.

> The $3^{rd}$ type was generated by the R script, but the rest were attempts
in Python.
